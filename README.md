# Secure E-Voting System Using Ethereum Blockchain

This project is a decentralized and tamper-proof e-voting system built using **Ethereum blockchain**, **Solidity smart contracts**, and a **React.js frontend**. It leverages **MetaMask** for secure user authentication and the **Polygon Mumbai Testnet** for low-cost, scalable deployment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional voting systems often face issues like vote tampering, lack of transparency, and centralized control. This project addresses these challenges by:

- Ensuring **vote integrity** and **immutability** using blockchain.
- Enforcing **one vote per person** through smart contract logic.
- Providing a **user-friendly interface** for casting and verifying votes.
- Maintaining **voter anonymity** while offering **public verifiability**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Solidity** – For smart contract development  
- **Hardhat** – Ethereum development environment  
- **React.js** – Frontend framework  
- **Web3.js** – Blockchain integration in frontend  
- **MetaMask** – Wallet-based authentication  
- **Polygon Mumbai Testnet** – Blockchain network for testing  
- **Infura** – Remote Ethereum node provider  

## 🧱 System Architecture

1. **Frontend (React.js)** – Voter dashboard with real-time feedback and verification.
2. **Smart Contracts (Solidity)** – Handle registration, voting, and validation logic.
3. **Blockchain Layer (Polygon Testnet)** – Stores and verifies all transactions.
4. **Authentication (MetaMask)** – Wallet-based user login and transaction signing.

## 🔐 Key Features

- ✅ Secure one-time voting using wallet validation  
- ✅ Admin dashboard for candidate and voter registration  
- ✅ Vote status feedback and transaction hash verification  
- ✅ Real-time vote count display  
- ✅ Smart contract enforced access control  
- ✅ On-chain immutability and transparency

## 🧪 Testing & Deployment

- All contracts tested locally using Hardhat.
- Deployed to the **Polygon Mumbai Testnet**.
- Vote transactions confirmed in under 4 seconds.
- Transaction hashes verifiable via [Polygonscan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com).

## 💠 Installation & Setup

### 📆 Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### ▶️ Run Hardhat Local Node (Optional)

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

### 🚀 Deploy Smart Contracts
